## Case Study #2: Pizza Runner

This is the second case study in the "8 Week SQL Challenge" (https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/).

In this Case, the task at hand is to clean up data before performing multiple sql queries to answer the questions given.

Unlike Case Study 1, this Case Study is broken up into 5 parts, A-E. I created 6 files to separate the data cleaning and each of the separate parts.
